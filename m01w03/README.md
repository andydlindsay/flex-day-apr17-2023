# M01W03 - TDD, CommonJS, and NPM

### To Do
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Making assertions
- [x] Bringing in outside code
- [x] Exporting our code
- [x] Intro to NPM: a Node package manager
- [x] Mocha test runner
- [x] Ignoring files/folders
- [x] Chai assertion library
- [x] What is TDD?
- [x] Practice unit testing

### Types of Testing
* Manual - run the code and inspect the output
* Unit testing - tests for the smallest units of code (aka functions)
  * actual vs expected

### Assertion Library
* JS library filled with helper functions
* assertion === forceful statement of fact or belief
* if the assertions fail, an error is thrown

### What is Node?
* It's a JS interpreter aimed at server-side code
* Google V8 Engine is the interpreter

### NPM
* node package manager
* npm is installed with node
* `package.json` contains information about the project

### Installation options
* global install (`npm install -g package`) on our operating system
* project dependency (`npm install package`) something our project directly depends on to run
* development dependency (`npm install --save-dev package`) will not be installed in production

### TDD
* test-driven development
  * tests are written first; then the code
  * red, green
* n-driven development
  * component
  * resume
