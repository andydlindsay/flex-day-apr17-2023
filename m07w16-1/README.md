# M07W16 - React Fundamentals

### To Do
- [x] What is React?
- [x] Create a project with Create React App
- [x] Components
- [x] JSX
- [x] Props
- [x] State
- [x] Event Handlers
<!-- - [ ] Controlled Inputs -->

### What is React?
* a library for creating user interfaces (React-DOM, React-Native, React Ink)
* declarative - specify what we want to see, not how it's implemented
* component-based - divide up the UI into smaller pieces (reusable)


* CommonJS Syntax (CJS) => exclusive to Node
  * module.exports
    * module.exports.myVar = 'hello';
    * module.exports = Header;
  * require
* ECMAScript Modules (ESM) => modern JS
  * export => exporting a key
    * export const myVar = 'hello';
  * export default => the main export from the file
    * export default Header
  * import

* props => data from outside the component/function
* state => data that belongs to a component/function


### Hook
* helper function that interacts with React
* useState

* const arr = useState(initialValue)
* const getter = arr[0]
* const setter = arr[1]

* oldValues vs newValues
* count = 0 vs count = 1 => re-render

* render => React calls your function and gets back the return value
