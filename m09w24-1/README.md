# M09W24 - Rails Review

### To Do
- [x] Ruby Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app

### Ruby Convo
* thought it was okay

### MVC
* Model - data abstraction layer
* View - UI; generates the HTML, collection of helper functions
* Controller - brains of the operation
* Router - determines which controller to call

Convention over Configuration (idiomatic)
