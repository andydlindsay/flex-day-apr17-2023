# M01W02 - Objects in JS

### To Do
- [x] Review primitive types
- [x] Objects!
- [x] Passing primitives and objects to functions
- [x] Functions inside objects (using `this`)
- [x] Object iteration with `for..in`

### Review Primitive Types
* stored directly in memory (RAM)
* they cannot be changed after they are set

```js
const str = 'hello world'; // str.length new String()
const bool = true;
const num = 3.14;
const nul = null;
const undef = undefined;

const sym = Symbol('hello');
const bigint = 4783784n;
```

### Objects
* objects
* arrays
* functions

Use for..of with everything except objects, because Of and Object both start with 'O'
